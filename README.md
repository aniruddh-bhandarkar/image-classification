# Image Classification and Detection
This is the Project that I completed during my internship at InfiVR in Late 2022 which involves classifying images using OpenCV and DNN.
I used Python's extensive libraries to ensure that the images were detected.
The code had the ability to classify 500 images into light and dark with a threshold of 45% for the images.
